In this project, I examine the effect of date/time and weather on the wait time that a traveler faces while crossing the Peace Bridge between Canada and the United States. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used for analysis to compute the regression results. The Logistic Regression is used to predict/estimate when travel will be delayed by ‘x minutes’ due to specific hours or weather type. The model is tested via dataset of wait time (y-variable) which is the dependent variable and time hours (x-variable) & weather conditions (x-variable) which are the independent variables for the years 2010-2016 for training the model and 2017 for testing the model. The findings illustrate how, for different hours & weather conditions plays roles in predicting wait time for a given data. The model’s predictability is 55% which can further help travelers analyze/plan their trip in advance with respect to further improvements in the model.
